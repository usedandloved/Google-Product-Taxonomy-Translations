# Google-Product-Taxonomy-Translations

## File names

Google source files take the format `taxonomy-with-ids.{locale}.txt`
e.g. taxonomy-with-ids.en-GB.txt

Translated files take the format `taxonomy-with-ids.{target-locale}-{source-locale}.txt`

## File content

The `.txt` files first line is the title with version
e.g. # Google_Product_Taxonomy_Version: 2021-09-21

## Branches

### Main

Main branch is used for google original files and completed translations.

To work on a translation, go to the correct branch, `{target-locale}-{source-locale}-{version}`.

E.g. cy-GB-en-GB-2021-09-21 for the Welsh (GB) translation from the English (GB) of google's 2021-09-21 version.

Create a branch if it doesn't already exist.
